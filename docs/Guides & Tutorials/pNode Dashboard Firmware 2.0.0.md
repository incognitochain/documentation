**Congratulations** on successfully upgrading your pNode to the latest and greatest firmware! :partying_face: Below is an outline of how to access the new and improved features of your pNode. 

<br/>

Didn't upgrade? If your pNode ran into a problem and still does not show v2.0.0 please follow the following advanced instructions. On your computer open a terminal (windows search Windows PowerShell / on mac /Applications/Utilities Terminal) and type:
>ssh nuc@**pNode_IP_Address**

(replace **pNode_IP_Address** with your pNode IP Address)

hit enter

When prompted for a password type:
>Binh!2345

Once logged in type the following and hit enter:
> s2b -d '{"action": "update_firmware"}' -t product_control
>
> sudo service supervisor restart
> 
> sudo service nginx restart

*You can copy and paste to make things easier. Copy from here and then right-click on the terminal screen.*

another way you can keep ssh with manual detail command to download and replace new pnode ui.

script : 

> cd ~/aos/ability/
> 
> wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/robotbase-cloud-2/static/upload_apps/product_control_2.0.2_2_411.zip
> 
> unzip -o product_control_2.0.2_2_411.zip
> 
> cd ~/
> 
> tmux kill-session -t brain
> 
> bash ~/aos/boot.sh
> 
> sudo service supervisor restart
> 
> sudo service nginx restart

Wait for the upgrade to complete. After the upgrade has completed your pNode should now be on v2.0.0

The terminal page gives you access to a terminal running on your pNode. Please note this is only recommended for advanced users.

There are convenient quick access buttons located below the terminal window. In the event of a beacon and/or shard stall these buttons can be utilized to clear problematic data. 

When clicking to delete data a confirmation box will pop up asking you to verify deleting data. Please only use these buttons when a stall occurs or as directed by the support team.

**Please put your pNode QR code into the box referenced in figure 3 prior to utilizing the quick action buttons (pNode QR codes are located on the bottom of the pNode device).**

## File Explorer / Logs

In the event you need to browse the pNodes files or pull logs you can do so by accessing the file explorer by clicking the `Browser` button at the top (reference figure 5).
